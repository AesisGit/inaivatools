# Incodaq tools

Incodaq tools is a web app that offers set of online tools for easier completion of daily office tasks.
There are two types of tools this app has to offer. Free tools that can be freely accessed and Locked tools where you are required to sign in.
Locked tools are intended to be used by a small group of people to help them with their daily business routines. Therefore, that means there is no open registration available.


Currently there are 3 tools:
Merge text lines tool -
This tool is used for merging several rows into one row joined by symbols or characters of users choice.


Format telephone numbers - Swedish edition -
The idea behind this tool is to be used in fixing telephone numbers to fit into Swedish telephone number format. User just needs to copy Swedish telephone numbers - one number per row- and press a button.


Format telephone numbers from Excel, Swedish edition -
This tool does all the things just as one explained above but with the convenience of uploading Excel files from which telephone numbers are automatically standardized to Swedish telephone standard. After the processing of the file is done the fixed file is available for download.
