                                            <h3>Hot to use & Functionalities</h3>
                                            There are two types of tools here on Incodaq Tools: Free tools you can access by going to 
                                            <a href="{% url 'index' %}" class="">Home page</a>
                                            and Locked tools where you are required to <a href="{% url 'login' %}" class=""> Sign in</a> to be able to use.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            Locked tools are intended to be used by a small group of people to help them in their daily business routines. Therefore, that means there is no open registraion available.
                                            <br/>
                                            But don't despair, if you would like to use locked tools feel free to contact me via email provided on the support page!                                            <br/><br/>
